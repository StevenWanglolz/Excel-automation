create/update these

1️⃣ README.md (always)

Purpose: Re-orient yourself (and anyone else) in 2–5 minutes.

Keep it short.

Include:
 • What this project is (1 paragraph)
 • What problem it solves
 • How to run it locally
 • Tech stack (very high level)
 • Link to deeper docs (below)

Example outline:

# Project Name

## What this is

Short description of the system and its goal.

## Tech

- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- [Other important tools]

## Run locally

npm install
npm run dev

## Where to look

- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md – how things fit together
- docs/DATA_FLOW.md – where data comes from and goes

⸻

2️⃣ docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

Purpose: Big-picture understanding.

This is the most important doc after README.

Include:
 • Main parts of the system (frontend, backend, APIs, etc.)
 • How they talk to each other
 • Major design decisions (briefly)
 • What kind of app this is (CRUD, dashboard, automation, etc.)

Do not include:
 • Implementation details
 • Line-by-line explanations

This doc should answer:

“How is this system structured in my head?”

⸻

3️⃣ docs/DATA_FLOW.md

Purpose: Prevent confusion and bugs.

Include:
 • Where data originates (user input, API, DB)
 • How it moves through components/functions
 • Where state lives
 • Where side effects happen
 • When listing out steps, include code snippets for every step

This doc should answer:

“If something looks wrong in the UI, where do I trace it back?”

For example:
**Step 1: User enters credentials**

```typescript
// frontend/src/components/Auth/Login.tsx (lines 12-28)
const handleSubmit = async (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setError(null);

  try {
    // OAuth2PasswordRequestForm expects 'username' field, but we use email
    // This mapping allows compatibility with backend OAuth2 endpoint
    await login({ username: email, password });
    // Navigate to dashboard on successful login
    navigate('/');
  } catch (err: unknown) {
    // Extract error message from API response
    // Backend returns errors in format: { response: { data: { detail: string } } }
    const error = err as { response?: { data?: { detail?: string } } };
    setError(error.response?.data?.detail || 'Login failed');
  }
};

⸻

4️⃣ docs/STATE.md (optional but very useful in React)

Purpose: Clarify ownership.

Include:
 • What state exists
 • Who owns it (component, hook, server)
 • Why it lives there
 • What triggers updates

This prevents:
 • duplicated state
 • unnecessary effects
 • weird re-render bugs

⸻

5️⃣ docs/API.md (if you have APIs)

Purpose: Contract clarity.

Include:
 • Available endpoints
 • What they do
 • Input/output shape (high level)
 • Error cases worth knowing

Do not:
 • auto-generate massive Swagger docs unless needed

⸻

6️⃣ docs/DECISIONS.md

Purpose: Remember why you did things.

Include short entries like:

## 2025-01-10 – Chose local state over global store

Reason: app is small, simpler mental model.
Revisit if: state is shared across >3 features.

This is gold when you return months later.

⸻

7️⃣ docs/LEARNING.md (personal but powerful)

Purpose: Track your understanding.

Include:
 • Concepts you’ve learned
 • Things that confused you but now make sense
 • Patterns you want to reuse

Example:

- useEffect dependencies: now understand why missing deps cause bugs
- Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs

This is for you, not others.

⸻

8️⃣ File-level comments (not a separate file)

At the top of important files:

/**

- Responsible for:
- - Fetching and displaying user data
-
- Key assumptions:
- - User ID is available from route params
-
- Be careful:
- - Changing effect deps may cause refetch loops
 */

This often replaces the need for extra docs.

⸻

📁 Final suggested structure

README.md
docs/
  ARCHITECTURE.md
  DATA_FLOW.md
  STATE.md
  API.md
  DECISIONS.md
  LEARNING.md
  FILES.md

You don’t need all of them on day one.
Start with:
 • README.md
 • ARCHITECTURE.md
 • DATA_FLOW.md

Add the rest only when useful.

⸻

🔑 Golden rule (this matches your Cursor rule)

If you can:
 • stop coding for 2 weeks
 • come back
 • read docs for 10 minutes
 • and confidently modify code

Then you have enough documentation.
Yep — that’s a very good doc to add, and it fits perfectly with how you work and how Cursor operates.

This doc’s job is simple:

“I forgot everything. Where do I look?”

⸻

✅ Add this documentation file

📄 docs/ FILES.md

Purpose:
Explain what every important file and folder does, at a human level.

This is not about code details.
It’s about orientation.

⸻

What this doc answers
 • “Which file should I touch for X?”
 • “If something breaks here, what’s the blast radius?”
 • “Which files are safe vs dangerous to modify?”
 • “Why does this file even exist?”

This doc alone can save you hours when you come back after time away.

⸻

Recommended structure

🔹 Top-level overview

Start with a short explanation:

# File Map

This document explains the purpose of each major file and folder.
It is meant for quick re-orientation, not implementation details.

⸻

🔹 Folder-by-folder breakdown

Example for a React / Next.js app:

## app/

Main application routes and UI.

### app/page.tsx

- Entry point for the home page.
- Composes high-level UI sections.
- Should stay thin (no business logic).

### app/dashboard/page.tsx

- Dashboard screen for logged-in users.
- Fetches and displays user-specific data.
- Be careful: depends on auth state.

⸻

🔹 Group related files

Don’t list everything.
Only list files that matter.

## components/

Reusable UI components.

### components/Button.tsx

- Generic button used across the app.
- No business logic.
- Safe to modify styles.

### components/UserCard.tsx

- Displays user info.
- Expects a fully-formed User object.
- If props change, update usages everywhere.

⸻

🔹 Backend / API files (if any)

## app/api/

Server-side routes.

### app/api/users/route.ts

- Handles fetching users from the database.
- Used by dashboard and admin pages.
- Changes here affect multiple screens.

⸻

🔹 Utility & config files

## lib/

Shared logic.

### lib/db.ts

- Database client initialization.
- Should only be imported server-side.
- Do not add business logic here.

### lib/auth.ts

- Auth helpers.
- Assumes user session is already validated.

⸻

🔹 Mark danger levels (optional but very helpful)

You can annotate files like this:

🟢 Safe to edit
🟡 Edit carefully
🔴 Understand before touching

Example:

### lib/state.ts 🔴

- Central state logic.
- Small changes can cause cascading bugs.

This helps future you make smart decisions fast.

⸻

How detailed should it be?
 • 1–5 bullets per file
 • No code blocks
 • No explanations of React/TS syntax
 • Focus on responsibility, not implementation

If a file needs more explanation → link to another doc.
