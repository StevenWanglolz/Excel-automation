When writing or modifying code:
 • Write clear, readable code over clever or compact code.
 • Add comments where intent is not obvious, explaining why the code exists or what would break if changed.
 • Avoid narrating obvious syntax.

Documentation rules:
 • Always create or update documentation when behavior, structure, or data flow changes.
 • Documentation should explain:
 • what the code is responsible for
 • how data flows through it
 • important assumptions or constraints
 • Keep documentation concise and practical, not exhaustive.

Learning focus:
 • Explain code to a level where I can reason about it, not necessarily understand every line.
 • If something is complex or easy to misuse, add a brief explanation or note.
 • Prefer small explanations near the code over large standalone docs.

Maintenance:
 • If existing comments or docs are outdated, update or remove them.
 • If code becomes harder to understand, suggest simplification.

Goal:

I should be able to return after time away and quickly understand what this code does, why it exists, and what I should be careful about.
