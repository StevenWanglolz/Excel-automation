# User Manual

This guide walks through the three advanced scenarios (group-to-group, group-to-many, many-to-many) from uploading files through configuring sources and the row filter block to exporting the results.

## Shared workflow (applies to every scenario)
1. **Upload files**
   - Click the **Data** block and upload files. Use the grouped upload area to create a batch when you want multiple files to stay together and the single-file uploader for individual inputs.
   - Once files finish uploading the page will show the batch name plus any single files in the source panel.
2. **Open the Row Filter block**
- Add a **Row Filter** block from the **Selection & Rows** category and click it so the properties panel slides in.
- Use the **Add source** button to append a row. Each row now includes the grouped **Source** dropdown (single files, batches with a “Use all {Batch}” option, or processed streams) plus its sheet selector right below.
- Destinations show a `Linked sources` multi-select so the same output file can reference several inputs, making manual rerouting or append-style exports easy without leaving the panel.
- Once a row is configured you can use **Create destination from this file** to immediately create a linked destination with the matching source.
3. **Configure the operation**
   - The **Operation** section appears between Sources and Destinations.
- Select a **Column** (drop-down is populated from the first source preview), pick an **Operator**, and enter the comparison **Value** (skipped automatically for blank checks).
- While previewing the block, use the batch/individual/all toggles in the preview header so the file selector only lists the source files added to this block. This keeps the preview aligned with the actual g2g/g2m/m2m routing you just configured.
- When several batches feed the block, use the File group dropdown above the file list to pick the specific batch you want to inspect.
4. **Review destinations**
   - The **Destinations** section shows output files you can write to. Add destinations as needed; when groups are present we auto-generate matching slots and surface the `Auto-generating N destinations` banner.
   - The new “Create destination from this file” link on each source helps you jump directly to the matching destination row.
5. **Export**
   - Click the output block and hit **Export** to trigger the backend export APIs. Group sources automatically keep their batch structure unless you pair them to fewer destinations (append/merge).

## Scenario 1: Group-to-Group (1:1)
- **Goal**: Keep each file inside a batch paired with a corresponding destination so each exported file mirrors one input.
- Upload a batch of files into a named group.
- Use the Add source button, then pick the batch files via each row’s Source dropdown. The banner `Auto-generating X destinations` confirms we detected the batch and will auto-create the matching outputs.
- Do not consolidate destinations; leave one auto-generated destination per file. Each destination keeps the origin in the `Source` drop-down so the backend can match the streams 1:1.
- Export and the system writes one output per original file with the same ordering.

## Scenario 2: Group-to-Many (append)
- **Goal**: Take the whole batch, run the row filter once, and append the results into one or two output files.
- Upload a batch, add rows with **Add source**, and use each row’s Source dropdown to grab the batch files. Add fewer destinations than sources so the pipeline knows to append (the opposite of the 1:1 case).
- Explicitly choose the destination file(s) you want to write to and keep the `Source` column set to “From Row Filter” so the system knows which stream to append.
- The backend detects the append pattern and writes the filtered rows from every source file into each configured destination file.

## Scenario 3: Many-to-Many (single files)
- **Goal**: Select individual files (not a batch) and map each to its own output file.
- Upload files using the single-file area. Each new source row exposes the “Single files” optgroup so you can pick the unbatched files you want.
- Add a Row Filter source entry for each file; the per-entry file selector now only shows single (unbatched) files so you cannot accidentally mix them with grouped inputs.
- Create destinations with one-to-one mapping (source-to-destination pair) and run Export. The system zips the multiple outputs when more than one file is created.

## Notes & tips
- Each source row in the Properties panel keeps the list short and grouped by batch. Processed streams inherit the `(processed)` suffix so you can tell which sources were generated by earlier transforms.
- The `Export Batch` banner only appears when you are working with a batch. It shows how many destinations will be created automatically; clicking **Add destination** lets you override that if the automatic behavior is not what you need.
- When a column list is empty, upload/select a source to load columns before picking an operator.
- Use the **Create destination from this file** action on a source entry to quickly add a destination row that is already paired to that source (the UI drops you into the destination editor with the same source selected).
- The `Linked sources` multi-select inside each destination allows you to tie that output to one or more sources after it is created. Select multiple entries (Shift/Cmd) to mark a destination as reusing the same output for different inputs or append-friendly flows.
